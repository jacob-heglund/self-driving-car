# Visual Navigation for Autonomous Road-Going Vehicles

This project involved choosing some topic related to navigation systems and working to learn about a new topic.  My focus was on visual navigation for autonomous vehicles operating on the road.  In particular, I have never worked with computer vision tools before and wanted to apply these tools to solve the problem of lane marker detection using only classical computer vision techniques.

This page is to show the visual results (i.e. videos) of the lane detectors working.  Please see ./docs/final_report.pdf for a more in-depth explanation of the work done for this project.
